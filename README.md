# PyTorchForge: a low code platform for creating Deep Learning pipelines with minimal coding

- This repo is the agrregate of the client here and the server from [here](https://github.com/Haroon-64/AutoPipeline)
- current capabilities include:
- - choosing each step from data loading, task selection, creating dataloaders, building custom models, setting training and generating the code to run the pipeline

# Future goals
- run from the app
- remove the code that still needs to be checked and verified
- view and comapre results from runs
- visualise the pipeline and model
